    <dc:title>Digitale Bibliothek Th√ºringen (Digital Library of Thuringia)</dc:title>

    <dc:description>A fundamental principle of the publication of documents is the idea of open access.
    Apart from a few exceptions, all full texts are publicly available.
    You can publish your electronical documents in the DBT, too.
    Your publication is not only worldwide available on the internet, its long-term availability is also guaranteed.
    
    All dissertations and habilitations as a digital version as well as final theses meeting certain criteria are stored in the DBT.
    You find here all necessary information for submitting your dissertation/habilitation and final thesis at your own university. 
    
    The multimedia center provides current recordings of lectures with a synchronized presentation and stores it in the DBT.
    A large number of presentations from many departments are already available.
    Furthermore, conferences, workshops and events of the university are also recorded.
